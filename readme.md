# SymPathiCo: Harnessing Evolutionary Adaptation for Calculus-Free Neural Computing

## Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, traditional neural network architectures have consistently relied on complex calculus and weight-based adjustments for training and optimization. Despite their successes, these networks face scalability challenges, veer more and more from the intuitive natural analogies that inspired them, and struggle with the inherent complexities of high-dimensional data spaces that exacerbate the curse of dimensionality.

This paper introduces SymPathiCo (Symbolic Pathing Colonies), a novel approach that eschews conventional weight matrices, backpropagation, and even layered architectures in favor of a dynamic, arbitrarily wired, evolutionary framework. By conceptualizing the neural network as a colony of symbolic paths—each representing a possible sequential activation of neurons—SymPathiCo aligns more closely with organically inspired principles seen in natural processes such as waterways and ant trails, where paths, not abstract matrices, underpin essential processes.

SymPathiCo's evolutionary adaptation of paths within a neural colony, driven by real-time interaction with input-output pairs, proposes a novel method of “training” through the replication of successful activation sequences. The paper also introduces a necessity-driven activation function based on a “spillover” concept, which models non-linearity, essential for complex problem-solving, in a calculus-free and intuitively natural manner.

Given the network’s structure as a vast population of paths, SymPathiCo hints at unprecedented scalability, with the capacity for thousands of machines to asynchronously contribute to the evolution of the colony. This intuition, while yet to be rigorously tested, suggests a new frontier in neural network architectures’ scalability and distributed computing capabilities.

To facilitate exploration and experimentation with SymPathiCo, we provide a software framework including a Python package and a Colab notebook, enabling the community to test and extend the approach further.
